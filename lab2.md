**IMPORTANT**: For the VHDL implementations please have a look at the end of the _Lecture 1_ documentation

## Questions from Lecture 1
1. What programming language do we use during the labs?
2. What is the significance of Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)?
3. What are some different ways that a MIPS' ISA can be organized?
4. Explain the difference between RISC and CISC type CPUs.
5. What is the difference between Little Endian & Big Endian?
6. What are the two main types of instruction formats?

## Questions from A7 Appendix & Lab 1
1. What are the __three__ main tasks that are required to run in order to get your code uploaded to the dev boards?
2. What is the _synthesis_ task responsible for?
3. What is the _implementation_ task responsible for?
4. What is the _generate bitstream_ task responsible for?
5. What are the **six** most basic logic gates used during the labs?
6. What is a **latch**? Write the corresponding code for it in VHDL.
7. What is a **D** _flip-flop_? Write the corresponding code for it in VHDL.
8. What is a **MUX**? Write the corresponding code for it in VHDL (4-to-1 1-bit) and draw the schematic.
9. What is a **decoder** (DCD)? Write the corresponding code for it in VHDL (3-to-8) and draw the schematic.
10. What is a **counter**, what are some of the additional control signals usually used with counters? Write the corresponding code for a 16-bit up counter with an enable signal in VHDL and draw the schematic.
11. Draw the schematic for a mono pulse generator

## Questions from Lab 2
1. Is it possible to have all of the seven segment displays (individual digits) turned on EXACTLY at the same time (moment) or does it simply alternate so fast as to which one is turned on momentarily that it gives the "illusion" of being active?
2. Name the **six** basic ALU operations outlined in section _2.4_ from the lab documentation.
3. Explain what an **adder** does, draw the schematic and write the VHDL implementation.
4. Explain what a **subtractor** does, draw the schematic and write the VHDL implementation.
5. Explain what a **shifter** does, draw the schematic and write the VHDL implementation.
6. Explain what a **zero detector** does and write the VHDL implementation.
7. Explain what a **sign / zero extender** does and write the VHDL implementation.
8. Explain what a **comparator** does, draw the schematic and write the VHDL implementation.
