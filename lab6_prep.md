# CA LAB 6 PREPARATION QUESTIONS

1. The lecture & lab documentation presents a MIPS that's on how many bits?
2. The MIPS that you will be implementing is on how many bits?
3. What does it mean that a certain processor is on X bits?
4. What kind of MIPS are we implementing currently (single-cycle, multi-cycle, pipeline)?
5. What are the **five phases** of an instruction's execution cycle?
6. Which phase will we be dealing with in Lab 6?
7. What are the **three components** that make up the ID unit?
8. What is the only component that will be instantiated from another file out of the three?
9. True or False - The Instruction Memory (ROM) from the IF unit stores the instructions and the RF from the ID unit stores the operands.
10. Which RF operations are asynchronous and which ones are synchronous?
11. What logic gate will you use in order to validate the RegWrite control signal?
12. Which already available signal will you use for enabling the RegWrite control signal?
13. How many **lines of code** will you use for the _extension unit_?
14. For how many instructions is it enough to finish the control signals for **during lab hours**?
15. The control signals for the rest of the instructions are considered what?
16. What will you use in order to generate the _Write Data_ input for the RF?
17. In the previous lab, you had to display the **current instruction** and the address of the next instruction (**pc + 1**) in hexadecimal format on the 7-segment display, what else do you need to display on the 7-segment display this lab?
18. What values will you be displaying on the LEDs?
